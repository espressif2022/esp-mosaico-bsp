## Overview

ESP-Mosaico BSP is an ESP-IDF Board Support Package for the ESP-Mosaico development board. It provides a unified API for the onboard display, touch controller, audio codec, sensors, storage, power control, user input, and two hot-pluggable expansion slots.

The repository also includes reusable components for magnetic interaction, ESP-NOW peer communication, multi-device topology, and application messaging, together with standalone examples ranging from basic peripheral bring-up to camera, voice, AI, and multi-board applications.

## Compatibility

| Item | Support |
| --- | --- |
| SoC | ESP32-S31 |
| ESP-IDF | 6.2 or newer |
| Board revisions | v1.0 and v1.2 (v1.1 uses the v1.2 mapping) |

ESP32-S31 support may require the preview target command provided by the selected ESP-IDF release:

```bash
idf.py --preview set-target esp32s31
```

The main public header is [`components/esp-mosaico-bsp/include/bsp/esp_mosaico.h`](components/esp-mosaico-bsp/include/bsp/esp_mosaico.h). Peripheral-specific APIs are provided by the headers under [`components/esp-mosaico-bsp/include/bsp`](components/esp-mosaico-bsp/include/bsp).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- ESP-IDF 6.2 or newer with ESP32-S31 target support
- An ESP-Mosaico board
- A data-capable USB or UART cable suitable for the selected example

Follow the [ESP-IDF Get Started guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32s31/get-started/index.html) to install ESP-IDF and activate its environment.

### Use the BSP API

Include the board header to access all public BSP interfaces:

```c
#include "bsp/esp_mosaico.h"

void app_main(void)
{
    bsp_board_variant_t variant;
    ESP_ERROR_CHECK(bsp_board_variant_get(&variant));
    ESP_ERROR_CHECK(bsp_power_init());
    if (variant == BSP_BOARD_VARIANT_V1_0) {
        ESP_ERROR_CHECK(bsp_led_init());
        ESP_ERROR_CHECK(bsp_led_set(true));
    }
}
```

The BSP reads the hardware version from eFuse USER_DATA before configuring revision-dependent pins. Unsupported or unprogrammed versions return `ESP_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED`. Applications should check the return value of every BSP function and use the high-level peripheral and expansion-module APIs instead of configuring shared board resources directly.

### Configuration

Run `idf.py menuconfig` and open `ESP-Mosaico BSP` to configure the board-specific options:

- CO5300 tearing-effect synchronization
- LCD QSPI drive strength
- SPI NAND QIO mode
- Motor PWM control
- VCC 3.3 V soft-start time

## Components

### Board and common components

| Component | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`esp-mosaico-bsp`](components/esp-mosaico-bsp) | Board-level display, touch, audio, sensors, storage, power, input, and expansion-slot APIs |
| [`esp_lcd_co5300`](components/esp_lcd_co5300) | CO5300 SPI, QSPI, and MIPI-DSI LCD driver with Sleep In and Deep Standby support |
| [`mosaico_module_mgr`](components/mosaico_module_mgr) | Expansion-module discovery, descriptor validation, and exclusive slot lifecycle management |
| [`mosaico_interaction`](components/mosaico_interaction) | Hardware-independent magnetic classification, topology, and game primitives |
| [`mosaico_peer_link`](components/mosaico_peer_link) | ESP-NOW transport, contact-session negotiation, and topology propagation |
| [`mosaico_network`](components/mosaico_network) | High-level multi-device topology, routing, and application messaging service |

### Expansion modules

| Component | Description | Slot support |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`mosaico_module_camera`](components/mosaico_module_camera) | Managed OV3640/SC101IOT DVP camera with optional hardware JPEG decoding helpers | Left only |
| [`mosaico_module_button_led`](components/mosaico_module_button_led) | Two-button and three-WS2812 expansion module | Left or right |
| [`mosaico_module_joystick`](components/mosaico_module_joystick) | Dual-axis joystick with five buttons and non-blocking calibration | Left or right |
| [`mosaico_module_interact`](components/mosaico_module_interact) | Touch/button, motion, light, WS2812, and infrared interaction module | Left or right |

The two slots share board resources. Applications should use a concrete module driver, which discovers and claims the required slot through `mosaico_module_mgr`, rather than controlling connector pins directly.

## Examples

## Hardware Notes

- The Camera module is supported in the left slot only.
- Both expansion slots share I2C and other multiplexed resources. Slot ownership is exclusive while a concrete module driver is active.
- Some camera signals conflict with USB Serial/JTAG pins. Camera examples that document this conflict must be flashed and monitored through UART.
- Expansion-module EEPROM programming is a manufacturing operation and is not part of the public example workflow.
- The checked-in magnetic calibration profile is specific to the tested mechanical arrangement. Recalibrate and revalidate it after changing magnets, sensor orientation, enclosure, or assembly tolerances.

### Raylib games

| Example | Content |
| --- | --- |
| [Sky Hop](examples/sky_hop/README.md) | Platform model, scrolling and audio |
| [Tower Defense](examples/tower_defense/README.md) | Atlas, Tiled and deterministic Host replay |
| [Raylib Shooter](examples/raylib_shooter/README.md) | Shared RGB565 game rendering |

Clone this BSP repository and follow each game's build instructions. The game
CMake entry automatically downloads the exact engine and utils revisions in
[game_dependencies.json](examples/common/game_dependencies.json) into its build
directory. No adjacent repositories or vibe checkout are needed to build or
run the Host examples. These dependencies do not apply to base BSP components.

For Host behavior tests:

```sh
python -m pip install Pillow
cmake -S tools/game-dependencies -B build-game-deps
python -m unittest discover -s tests/games -v
```

Use `RAYLIB_LITE_ENGINE_ROOT` explicitly for an existing Host engine checkout.
Game installation retains the Recovery contract and uses the product CLI;
see the [game guide](docs/game-development.zh-CN.md).
